ZOMBIE HORDE
===============

Spawns Zombies at a constant interval from a team's spawnpoints.  Works really well with zf_dustbowl.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
Simply compile with the command 

> spcomp zombie_horde.sp

and put the compiled .smx file in your `"<modname>/addons/sourcemod/plugins"`
directory. 

The map you are on needs to have a nav mesh built if it is custom.  I built one for zf_dustbowl_b4 which is included in this repo.
